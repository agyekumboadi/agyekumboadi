# Samuel Boadi Agyekum

I build **data-driven, security-aware analytics systems** with a focus on **machine learning, explainability, and reproducible delivery**.  
My work spans **sports performance analytics** (football with **cross-sport testing**) and **information security / governance** in regulated environments.

I’m especially interested in turning messy, real-world data into decision-ready insights, while keeping implementations documented, versioned and maintainable.

---

## Current focus
- Building explainable ML pipelines (PCA, Random Forest, SHAP) with clear evaluation and reporting
- Expanding sports performance analytics from football to cross-sport generalisation/testing
- Strengthening security and governance work (GDPR, access control, auditability, risk-based controls)
- Publishing portfolio-ready evidence: READMEs, figures, releases, and structured documentation

## Featured projects
- **Player Performance ML Pipeline (Football → Cross-Sport)**  
  End-to-end ML workflow with feature engineering, PCA, model comparison, ROC/AUC evaluation, and SHAP explainability. Includes testing on non-football datasets to validate generalisation.

- **Pharmacy Stock Management System (Aronium POS + Reporting)**  
  Inventory and sales reporting solution supporting operational decision-making (fast movers, peak periods, stock visibility) with ongoing remote support and insight requests.

- **IS Governance / GDPR Case Study (Anonymised Care Provider)**  
  Practical governance framework work aligned to regulatory expectations, focusing on systems, process controls, and data protection considerations.

- **Dashboards Portfolio (Tableau • Looker Studio • Cognos • Excel)**  
  Multi-tool dashboard builds demonstrating KPI reporting, trends, segmentation, and storytelling across BI platforms.

- **WordPress Website Builds (richchotel.com • nagmaenfield.co.uk)**  
  Configuration-focused documentation of booking/forms workflows, plugin integration, email flow, and analytics monitoring.
