# Samuel Boadi Agyekum

I build **data-driven and security-aware analytics systems** focused on **machine learning, explainability, and reproducible delivery**.  
My work spans **sports performance analytics (football + cross-sport testing)** and **information security / governance** in regulated environments.

## Current focus
- Predictive modelling (Logistic Regression, Random Forest) with **PCA** and robust evaluation  
- Model explainability using **SHAP** (global + individual explanations)
- Translating analytics into **decision-ready outputs** (clear visuals, documented assumptions, reproducible runs)
- Security + governance in data projects (GDPR-aware processing, risk thinking, auditability)

## Featured projects
1) **MSc Dissertation – Player Performance Analytics (Multi-sport)**  
2) **Information Security Strategy & IT Security Management**  
3) **IS Governance Case Study (Regulated UK environment)**  

## Tech Nation evidence index
See: **[tech-nation-evidence](agyekumboadi/tech-nation-evidence)** - curated links to key outputs, figures, and supporting explanations.

## Tooling
Python (pandas, scikit-learn, SHAP), Jupyter, Tableau, Jamovi, Git/GitHub
